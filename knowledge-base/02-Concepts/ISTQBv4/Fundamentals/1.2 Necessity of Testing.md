**Testing**:
1. a form of quality control
2. achieve agreed goals within set scope, time, quality, budget constraints
3. provides cost-effective means to detect defects, indirectly contributes to higher quality test objects
4. direct evaluation of test object quality at SDLC stages
5. indirect representation of the development project

**Testing and QA**:
1. testing and QA are not the same
2. testing is a form of quality control

**QC**:
1. product-oriented, corrective approach
2. supports achieving appropriate levels of quality

**QA**:
1. process-oriented, preventive approach focusing on implementation and improvement of processes
2. applies to both development and testing precesses

**Test Results**:
1. used both in QC and QA
2. in **QC**: - to fix defects
3. in **QA**: - provide feedback in development and test process performance

**Errors, Defect, Failures, Root Causes**:

Humans make *errors* (mistakes), producing *defects* (faults, bugs), which may result in *failure*
Errors can be dues to various reasons

Defects can be found in documentation, test scripts, source code, supporting artifacts

Undetected defects in artifacts in early SDLC, result in defective artifacts later

A system fail to do what it should do or it shouldn't do, causing a failure

Defects may cause failure if executed, or under specific circumstances or not at all

*Errors and defects are not the only cause of failures.* Can be caused by environmental conditions

A **root cause** is a fundamental reason for a the occurrence of a problem

Can be identified with *root cause analysis* which is preformed when a failure occurs or a defect is identified

ALWAYS ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE!!!
