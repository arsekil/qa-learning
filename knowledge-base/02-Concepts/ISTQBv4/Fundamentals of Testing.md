**Software artifacts** === **test objects**

Software testing must be aligned with SDLC

Testing envolves: TESTING AND VALIDATION

Testing can be: 
1. dynamic
2. static

Testing types:
1.  Dynamic Testing: 
- different types of test techniques
- approaches to derive test cases
1. Static testing:
- reviews
- static analysis

Needs proper: 
- planning
- management
- estimation
- monitoring
- controll

Testers need:
- specialized knowledge
- analytical skills
- critical thinking
- systems thinking

K1:
- Typical test objectives:
	- evaluate work products(requirements, user stories, designs, code)
	- triggering failures and finding defects
	- ensure required coverage of a test object
	- reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality
	- verify specified requirmeents are fulfilled
	- verify a test object complies with contractual, legal and regulatory requirements
	- provide information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
	- build confidence in the quality of the test object
	- validate the the test object is complete and works as expected
- objectives can vary depending on the context

K2:
- Testing vs Debugging
	- they are separate activities
	- dynamic testing triggers a failuer, static testing identifies a defect
	- debugging means to find the root cause and eliminate the  bug
